# Periodic Table Project

## Overview

The Periodic Table Project is a Python application that utilizes the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface and MySQL for storing and retrieving information about the elements of the periodic table. The project aims to provide a comprehensive view of the periodic table, showcasing the properties and relevant information of each element.

## Features

- **Menu-Driven Structure:** The project is designed with a user-friendly menu-driven structure, making it easy for users to navigate and access information about specific elements.

- **Element Properties:** Detailed information about each element, including atomic number, symbol, name, atomic mass, and other relevant properties, is displayed.

- **MySQL Database:** The project utilizes a MySQL database to store and retrieve information about the elements, ensuring data persistence and efficient management.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for the project.

- **tkinter Library:** Employed for creating the graphical user interface, enabling users to interact with the periodic table information seamlessly.

- **MySQL:** The relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data about the elements.
